# Akash Dahiya's Business Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently an MSc Business Analytics student, transitioning from a successful career in business development into the world of data.

This repository will house my projects as I develop my skills in:
* **Programming:** Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Scikit-learn)
* **Databases:** SQL
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Specialization:** Geospatial Analysis

My first project, **"Geospatial Intelligence for Supply Chain Resilience,"** is currently in progress.
